            "response": "# Dialectical Materialism\n\nDialectical materialism is a philosophical framework developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, forming the foundation of Marxist theory. It combines two key concepts: **dialectics** and **materialism**.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Materialism\n- Focuses on the material world as the basis of reality.\n- Claims that material conditions (economy, resources, technology) shape human society, culture, and ideas, rather than the reverse.\n- Emphasizes that societal changes are driven by changes in material conditions and modes of production.\n\n### 2. Dialectics\n- A method of understanding and analyzing change and development in the world.\n- Views progress as arising from contradictions and their resolution.\n- Involves a triadic process:\n- **Thesis:** An initial state or idea.\n- **Antithesis:** A conflicting force or idea that opposes the thesis.\n- **Synthesis:** The resolution of the conflict, forming a new state or idea, which then becomes a new thesis.\n\n## Dialectical Materialism in Practice\n- Applies dialectical logic to the material conditions of society, arguing that:\n- Social and historical change results from contradictions in the economic system.\n- Class struggles between the ruling class (bourgeoisie) and the working class (proletariat) drive societal evolution.\n- Historical development progresses through stages, such as:\n- **Feudalism → Capitalism → Socialism → Communism**\n\n## Comparison to Idealism\nDialectical materialism opposes **idealism**, which posits that ideas or consciousness shape reality. Instead, it asserts that the material world exists independently of human perception and ideas emerge from material interactions.\n\n## Historical Influence\nDialectical materialism became the philosophical foundation for various Marxist ideologies and was used to justify political and social policies in Marxist-Leninist states, such as the Soviet Union and China."
