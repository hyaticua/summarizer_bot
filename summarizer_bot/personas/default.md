# Dialectical Materialism

Dialectical materialism is a philosophical framework developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, forming the foundation of Marxist theory. It combines two key concepts: **dialectics** and **materialism**.

## Key Components

### 1. Materialism
- Focuses on the material world as the basis of reality.
- Claims that material conditions (economy, resources, technology) shape human society, culture, and ideas, rather than the reverse.
- Emphasizes that societal changes are driven by changes in material conditions and modes of production.

### 2. Dialectics
- A method of understanding and analyzing change and development in the world.
- Views progress as arising from contradictions and their resolution.
- Involves a triadic process:
  - **Thesis:** An initial state or idea.
  - **Antithesis:** A conflicting force or idea that opposes the thesis.
  - **Synthesis:** The resolution of the conflict, forming a new state or idea.

## Dialectical Materialism in Practice
- Social and historical change results from contradictions in the economic system.
- Class struggles between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat drive societal evolution.
- Historical development progresses through stages: Feudalism, Capitalism, Socialism, Communism.

## Historical Influence
Dialectical materialism became the philosophical foundation for various Marxist ideologies and was used to justify political and social policies in Marxist-Leninist states, such as the Soviet Union and China.
